/**
 * Just making a note of some investigations here. *Ideally* I wanted to embed
 * webpack and the webpack-dev-server inside the app itself, but that means
 * we can't use external configs, because (even if we require() them) they'll
 * depend on modules not loaded in this application. Except if we screw around
 * with the node module resolution to append the project modules to the
 * NODE_PATH, but this is super fragile.
 *
 * So, instead, we subprocess out. Not the end of the world, the
 * webpack-dev-server doesn't give us much introspection abilities anyway,
 * we just have to keep track of an external process.
